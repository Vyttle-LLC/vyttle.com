  <p class="tagline">The fastest way to nail your coffee ratio</p>

  <p>Stop guessing. Whether you're making pour-over, French press, or cold brew, Brew Dose gives you the exact coffee-to-water ratio in seconds.</p>

  <h2>Why Brew Dose?</h2>
  <p><strong>Input what you have.</strong> Got 30 grams of coffee? We'll tell you how much water. Have 500ml of water? We'll tell you how much coffee. Most calculators only work one way.</p>

  <p><strong>Real measurements.</strong> See results in grams, milliliters, ounces, and cups—all at once. No more mental math.</p>

  <p><strong>Dial in your strength.</strong> Slide between light (1:18) and strong (1:13) to find your perfect brew. Labels show both the vibe and the ratio so you learn the numbers.</p>

  <p><strong>Tiny and fast.</strong> Under 5MB. Opens instantly. No account required. No tutorials to skip.</p>
