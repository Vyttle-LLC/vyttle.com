  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Your preferences (like favorite brew methods and ratio settings) are stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage. If you enable iCloud, these preferences may sync across your devices via your personal iCloud account.</p>
  <p>We do not operate any servers that store your data.</p>
