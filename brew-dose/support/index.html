  <h2>Common Questions</h2>

  <h3>What ratio should I use?</h3>
  <p>It depends on your taste and brew method! A good starting point is 1:16 (one part coffee to 16 parts water). Slide toward 1:13 for stronger coffee or 1:18 for lighter brews.</p>

  <h3>What do the strength labels mean?</h3>
  <p>The labels (Light, Medium, Strong) are guides based on common preferences. The actual ratio number is shown alongside so you can learn what works for you.</p>

  <h3>Why does my coffee taste weak/strong?</h3>
  <p>Beyond ratio, factors like grind size, water temperature, and brew time all affect extraction. As a general rule: finer grinds and hotter water extract more, coarser grinds and cooler water extract less.</p>

  <h3>What's the difference between pour-over and drip?</h3>
  <p>Both use similar ratios (around 1:16), but pour-over gives you more control over the brewing process. The default ratios in the app are suggestions—feel free to adjust.</p>

  <h3>Can I save my favorite settings?</h3>
  <p>Yes! Tap the heart icon to save your current brew method and ratio as a favorite for quick access.</p>
