  <h2>Common Questions</h2>

  <h3>Is it safe to merge contacts?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Tidy Contacts always shows you a preview of the merged contact before making any changes. The merge process combines all information from both contacts—nothing is lost. We also recommend exporting a backup before making changes, just in case.</p>

  <h3>Why do I have so many duplicates?</h3>
  <p>Duplicates typically come from syncing contacts across multiple services (iCloud, Google, Exchange) or migrating from an old phone. Each service may have created its own copy of your contacts over time.</p>

  <h3>What counts as an "empty" contact?</h3>
  <p>An empty contact is one with no useful information—no name, no phone number, no email. Sometimes these are created accidentally or left over from old imports.</p>

  <h3>Can I undo a merge or delete?</h3>
  <p>Merges and deletes cannot be undone directly in the app. That's why we strongly recommend exporting a backup before making changes. You can restore from the .vcf file at any time.</p>

  <h3>How do I restore from a backup?</h3>
  <p>Open the .vcf file you exported, and iOS will offer to add those contacts back to your address book. Note that this adds contacts—it doesn't replace your current contacts.</p>

  <h3>Why does the app need access to all my contacts?</h3>
  <p>To scan for duplicates and missing information, Tidy Contacts needs to read your entire contact list. All processing happens on your device—your contacts are never sent anywhere.</p>
