  <h1>Tidy Contacts Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <h2>The Short Version</h2>
  <p><strong>We don't collect any of your data.</strong> Tidy Contacts processes your contacts entirely on your device. We never see your contact information, and we have no way to access it.</p>

  <h2>Contact Data</h2>
  <p>Tidy Contacts requires access to your contacts to function. This access is used solely to scan, analyze, and modify contacts at your request. All processing happens on your device.</p>
  <p>Your contact data is never transmitted to any server. We do not operate servers that could receive this data.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Tidy Contacts does not collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal information</li>
    <li>Contact data</li>
    <li>Usage analytics</li>
    <li>Crash reports (unless you opt in via Apple)</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Backup Files</h2>
  <p>When you export a backup of your contacts, the .vcf file is created locally on your device. Where you share or store that file is entirely up to you—we never see or access it.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Tidy Contacts does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

  <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>If you purchase the full version of Tidy Contacts, that transaction is processed by Apple and is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not receive any personal information from these transactions.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Tidy Contacts does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app does not require an account and does not collect personal information from any user.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
