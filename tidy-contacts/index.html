  <h1>Tidy Contacts</h1>
  <p class="tagline">See what's missing, fix what's broken, clean what's duplicated</p>

  <p>Your contacts are a mess. Years of syncing, switching phones, and importing address books have left you with duplicates, empty entries, and hundreds of contacts missing basic info. Tidy Contacts gives you a clear picture of what needs fixing—and the tools to fix it.</p>

  <h2>What You Get</h2>
  <p><strong>Health Dashboard.</strong> Scan your contacts in seconds and see exactly what's wrong: how many duplicates, who's missing a birthday, which entries have no useful info at all.</p>

  <p><strong>Smart Merge.</strong> Combine duplicate contacts without losing any data. Preview exactly what the merged contact will look like before you commit.</p>

  <p><strong>Find the Gaps.</strong> Surface contacts missing birthdays, photos, emails, or phone numbers. Focus on the people who matter by filtering to contacts with photos or favorites.</p>

  <p><strong>Clean House.</strong> Batch delete empty contacts and junk entries that are cluttering your address book.</p>

  <p><strong>Safe Backups.</strong> Export your entire address book to a .vcf file before making any changes. Your data, your control.</p>

  <h2>Privacy First</h2>
  <p>Your contacts never leave your phone. No account required. No cloud. No tracking. Just a simple tool that works.</p>
