  <h2>Common Questions</h2>

  <h3>Where are my recipes stored?</h3>
  <p>Your recipes are stored in your personal iCloud account. They sync automatically across all your Apple devices signed into the same iCloud account.</p>

  <h3>How do I import a recipe from a website?</h3>
  <p>Tap the + button and choose "Import from URL." Paste the recipe link and Stockpot will automatically extract the recipe details. Most major recipe sites are supported.</p>

  <h3>Can I share recipes with family members?</h3>
  <p>Yes! You can share individual collections with other iCloud users. They'll be able to view and add recipes to the shared collection.</p>

  <h3>Why can't I see my recipes on a new device?</h3>
  <p>Make sure you're signed into the same iCloud account and that iCloud Drive is enabled. Recipes may take a few minutes to sync on first launch.</p>

  <h3>How do I scan a recipe from a cookbook?</h3>
  <p>Tap the + button and choose "Scan Recipe." Point your camera at the recipe page and Stockpot will use text recognition to extract the ingredients and instructions.</p>
