  <h1>Stockpot</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Your recipes. Your cloud. No servers.</p>

  <p>Stockpot is a privacy-first recipe manager that stores everything in your iCloud. Import recipes from the web, scan cookbook pages, and share collections with family — all without creating an account or trusting your data to another server.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Import recipes from any URL</li>
    <li>Scan cookbook pages with OCR</li>
    <li>iCloud sync across all your devices</li>
    <li>Share recipe collections with family</li>
    <li>Meal planning and grocery lists</li>
    <li>Cook mode with large text and timers</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Your data stays yours.</strong> We don't collect any personal information. Recipes sync via your iCloud account — we never see them.</p>
