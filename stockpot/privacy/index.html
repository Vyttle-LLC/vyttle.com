  <h1>Stockpot Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <h2>The Short Version</h2>
  <p><strong>We don't collect any of your data.</strong> Your recipes are stored in your personal iCloud account. We never see them, and we have no way to access them.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Stockpot uses Apple's iCloud service to store and sync your recipes. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  <p>We do not operate any servers that store your recipes or personal information.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Stockpot does not collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal information</li>
    <li>Usage analytics</li>
    <li>Crash reports (unless you opt in via Apple)</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recipe Import</h2>
  <p>When you import a recipe from a URL, the app fetches that webpage directly from your device. We do not route this traffic through our servers or log which URLs you visit.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>If you share a recipe collection with others, that sharing is handled by Apple's CloudKit Sharing feature. The shared data remains in iCloud and is not processed by us.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Stockpot does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Stockpot does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app does not require an account and does not collect personal information from any user.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
