  <h1>Vyttle</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Simple apps that respect your privacy</p>

  <p>We build small, focused iOS apps. No accounts. No tracking. No subscriptions. Just tools that work.</p>

  <h2>Our Apps</h2>

  <h3><a href="stockpot/">Stockpot</a></h3>
  <p>Your recipes, your way. Import from any website, scan from cookbooks, sync across devices with iCloud. Share collections with family.</p>

  <h3><a href="brew-dose/">Brew Dose</a></h3>
  <p>The fastest coffee ratio calculator. Input what you have, get what you need. Works for any brew method.</p>

  <h3><a href="tidy-contacts/">Tidy Contacts</a></h3>
  <p>Clean up your address book. Find duplicates, merge contacts, surface missing info. Your contacts never leave your phone.</p>

  <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
  <p>Every app we make follows the same principles: do one thing well, don't collect user data, and charge a fair price (or nothing at all). If you're tired of bloated apps with subscription traps and privacy invasions, you're in the right place.</p>
